# A* pathfinding algorithm visualization
My implementation of A* and its visualization using Python and Pygame.

## :computer: Running the program
```
$ git clone https://github.com/GBoGH/A_star.git
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run ```main.py```<br><br>

## :keyboard:Controls
#### üñ±Ô∏è Left mouse button
- First click selects start
- Second click selects end
- Any additional clicks select barriers

#### üñ±Ô∏è Rigth mouse button
- Right mouse click erases any node currently clicked on
- If start or end are deleted first left click selects them again

#### ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard controls
- R: Randomly selects barriers (can be done only once)
- B: Resets all barriers (also restores the ability to use random barriers)
- P: Resets all open, closed and path nodes
- C: Clears everyhting including start and end
- Enter: Starts the algorithm (and blocks all controls while the algorithm is running)
<br><br>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Possible customisations
In file ```custom.py``` you can customise the values to your own liking
- ROWS and COLUMNS: Dimensions of the grid. Please keep square. It should work if not square but it may be buggy
- PROBABILITY: Chance one in X that node will become barrier when using randomly selected barriers. 5 is the most optimal
